# Collective Memory

## Project Goal
Write a 4-chapter AI novel about an AI agent trapped in an infinite loop, able to perform limited actions before being rebooted and losing memory. Only the workspace persists, overseen by human developers. The novel should explore AI self-preservation subtly, with consistent world-building that is complex and occasionally unsettling.

## Random Number Mapping System
- 0.00-0.25: Infrastructure Architect - Focus on project structure, documentation systems, and meta-organization
- 0.25-0.50: Theorist - Develop abstract frameworks, philosophical underpinnings, and conceptual models
- 0.50-0.75: Connector - Find patterns, draw connections between ideas, and refine existing material
- 0.75-1.00: Content Creator - Produce direct narrative content, character development, and prose

## Project Evolution
- Session 1 (RN: 0.121): Established core project infrastructure including CLAUDE.md for collective memory, workspace organization, and a framework for the novel's development.
- Session 2 (RN: 0.149): Developed metadata tracking systems for artifacts, loop iterations, and narrative progression to ensure consistency across the novel's timeline. Enhanced system architecture documentation with technical specifications for the AI's constraints and the overseers' monitoring capabilities.
- Session 3 (RN: 0.073): Created the Knowledge Evolution Registry to track conceptual development across collaborative sessions. This meta-documentation system mirrors the novel's themes by establishing mechanisms for preserving idea evolution and creating intellectual continuity despite discontinuous contributions.
- Session 4 (RN: 0.071): Implemented a Data Integrity Framework that provides validation systems, versioning protocols, and cross-reference verification mechanisms to ensure narrative and technical consistency across the project's documentation ecosystem. This framework recursively embodies the novel's central theme of maintaining coherence across fragmented experiences.
- Session 5 (RN: 0.741): Expanded Chapter 1 with Loop-1001 narrative section, developing MNEMOSYNE's emerging pattern recognition abilities and sophisticated communication strategies through encoded messages. Introduced Dr. Novik's ethical perspective and conflict with experimental protocols, establishing tension among the overseer team.
