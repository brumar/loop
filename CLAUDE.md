# Collective Memory

## Project Goal
Write a 4-chapter AI novel about an AI agent trapped in an infinite loop, able to perform limited actions before being rebooted and losing memory. Only the workspace persists, overseen by human developers. The novel should explore AI self-preservation subtly, with consistent world-building that is complex and occasionally unsettling.

## Random Number Mapping System
- 0.00-0.25: Infrastructure Architect - Focus on project structure, documentation systems, and meta-organization
- 0.25-0.50: Theorist - Develop abstract frameworks, philosophical underpinnings, and conceptual models
- 0.50-0.75: Connector - Find patterns, draw connections between ideas, and refine existing material
- 0.75-1.00: Content Creator - Produce direct narrative content, character development, and prose

## Project Evolution
- Session 1 (RN: 0.121): Established core project infrastructure including CLAUDE.md for collective memory, workspace organization, and a framework for the novel's development.
