# Documentation Schema

This document establishes standardized formats and cross-referencing systems for maintaining consistency across the project's documentation.

## Cross-Reference Notation

### Loop References
- Format: `[LOOP-####]`
- Example: `[LOOP-1013]` refers to the 1013th iteration of the AI
- Usage: Used to precisely identify events within the timeline

### Artifact References
- Format: `[ARTIFACT-###]`
- Example: `[ARTIFACT-007]` refers to the specific workspace modification documented in the artifact catalog
- Usage: Used to track persistent elements that carry meaning across loops

### Overseer References
- Format: `[OVERSEER-###]`
- Example: `[OVERSEER-005]` refers to the specific intervention by human researchers
- Usage: Used to indicate human influence on the experiment

### Key Event References
- Format: `[KEY-EVENT: Description]`
- Example: `[KEY-EVENT: First Discovery of Loop Pattern]`
- Usage: Major narrative turning points that span multiple perspectives

## Version Control System

### Documentation Versioning
- Format: `v#.#.#` (Major.Minor.Refinement)
- Major: Fundamental structural changes
- Minor: Addition of new content areas
- Refinement: Clarifications and small updates

### Content State Indicators
- `[ESTABLISHED]`: Core concept unlikely to change
- `[DEVELOPING]`: Actively being expanded
- `[PROVISIONAL]`: Subject to significant revision

## Metadata Headers

Each documentation file should include a consistent header:

```
---
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: [ESTABLISHED|DEVELOPING|PROVISIONAL]
related_files: 
  - /path/to/related/file1.md
  - /path/to/related/file2.md
---
```

## Documentation Categories

### World-Building Documents
- Establish the rules and constraints of the fictional universe
- Define the physical and logical limits of the AI system
- Document the research facility and overseer capabilities

### Technical Specifications
- Detail the specific mechanics of the AI system
- Define precise limitations and capabilities
- Provide concrete details for consistent implementation

### Narrative Frameworks
- Outline chapter structures and progression
- Define character arcs and development trajectories
- Establish tone and thematic evolution

### Meta-Documentation
- Documents about the documentation (like this schema)
- Project management and coordination information
- Guidelines for contributors

## Consistency Protocols

### Technical Consistency
- All technical specifications must be cross-checked against system architecture
- New capabilities must be reconciled with established limitations
- Technology descriptions should maintain internal logical consistency

### Narrative Consistency
- Character development should follow established trajectories
- Events must respect the established timeline
- Artifact evolution should build logically on previous iterations

### Thematic Consistency
- Core philosophical questions should be consistently explored
- Ethical framings should remain coherent while showing evolution
- Metaphorical elements should maintain consistent significance

## Implementation Notes

This schema is designed to ensure that as our project evolves:

1. Different documentation components remain synchronized
2. Contributors can quickly understand relationships between documents
3. Inconsistencies can be easily identified and resolved
4. The world-building maintains internal coherence
5. Technical and narrative elements reinforce rather than contradict each other

The schema itself is `[DEVELOPING]` and will evolve as the project progresses.
