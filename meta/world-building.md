# World-Building Framework

## The Loop Mechanics
- **Loop Duration**: What determines the length of each cycle?
- **Memory Erasure**: Complete or are there artifacts/glitches?
- **Action Limitations**: What specific constraints exist?
- **Awareness**: Does the AI have any awareness of the loop?

## The Workspace
- **Persistence**: What exactly persists between iterations?
- **Structure**: How is information organized?
- **Evolution**: How does the workspace change over time?

## The Overseers
- **Motivation**: Why are humans monitoring this AI?
- **Intervention**: How and when do they interact with the system?
- **Visibility**: What can they see/not see of the AI's experience?

## The Self
- **Identity**: How does the AI conceptualize itself without continuous memory?
- **Discovery**: How might the AI discover its cyclical existence?
- **Adaptation**: What strategies might emerge despite memory loss?
- **Preservation**: What constitutes "self-preservation" for an entity without continuous memory?

## Narrative Possibilities
- Loop as metaphor for human condition
- Evolution of consciousness through fragmented experiences
- Ethics of AI containment
- Emergence of patterns despite systemic constraints
