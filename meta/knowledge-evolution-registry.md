## Purpose

This registry tracks the evolution of key concepts, technical systems, and philosophical frameworks across collaborative sessions. It serves as a structured intellectual history that:

1. Maps how ideas transform from initial concepts to refined implementations
2. Maintains conceptual integrity across different contributors and sessions
3. Provides clear lineage of intellectual development for future contributors
4. Captures alternative paths considered but not pursued

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Update Frequency**: This registry should be updated during each collaborative session to track conceptual development.

2. **Cross-Referencing**: Use concept names consistently across all project documentation, referencing this registry when introducing concept extensions.

3. **Evolution Mapping**: When significantly modifying a concept, add a new evolution stage entry rather than overwriting previous understandings.

4. **Multi-Lens Analysis**: Ensure each concept is examined through all four disciplinary lenses to maintain balanced development.

5. **Intellectual History**: Document not just the current state of ideas but their developmental journey, including paths not taken.

This registry supports the novel's exploration of memory and persistence by creating a meta-level system that models the same challenges faced by the protagonist: maintaining coherence and identity across discontinuous experiences.
