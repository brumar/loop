## Purpose

The Versioning Protocol establishes a systematic approach to track, manage, and preserve the evolution of both narrative content and meta-documentation across the development of the novel. This protocol serves as a bridge between the Data Integrity Framework and the project's collaborative creation process, ensuring that:

1. Changes to documentation and narrative elements are tracked with proper provenance
2. The development history itself becomes a meta-narrative mirroring the novel's themes
3. Different versions can be compared to understand conceptual evolution
4. The collaborative process maintains coherence despite being discontinuous

## Version Identification System

### Semantic Versioning Structure

```
[DOC-TYPE]-[MAJOR].[MINOR].[REVISION]-[SESSION]
```

Where:
- **DOC-TYPE**: Category identifier (META, CHAP, ARTF, CHAR, SYS)
- **MAJOR**: Significant conceptual or structural changes
- **MINOR**: Extensions or refinements to existing concepts
- **REVISION**: Small updates, corrections, or clarifications
- **SESSION**: The session number where this version was created

Example: `META-1.3.2-S7` indicates the 7th session's 2nd revision of the 3rd minor version of the 1st major version of a meta-document.

### Change Classification Guidelines

**Major Changes (increment MAJOR)**:
- Introduction of new foundational concepts
- Significant restructuring of document organization
- Changes that alter the interpretation of existing content

**Minor Changes (increment MINOR)**:
- Addition of new sections that extend existing concepts
- Refinement of ideas that enhance but don't fundamentally alter meaning
- Integration of concepts across previously separate domains

**Revisions (increment REVISION)**:
- Clarifications of existing content
- Correction of inconsistencies
- Enhancement of examples or explanations

## Implementation Mechanisms

### Version Headers

Each document should include a version header in its metadata:

```
---
version: META-1.0.0-S7
previous_version: META-0.9.5-S6
last_updated: 2025-05-20
change_type: [MAJOR|MINOR|REVISION]
change_summary: "Brief description of significant changes"
---
```

### Change Documentation

Significant changes should be documented within the Knowledge Evolution Registry, linking the version change to the conceptual evolution:

```
#### Evolution Stages
- **Seed [Session 7, RN: 0.038]**: Initial versioning protocol established (META-1.0.0-S7)
- **Elaboration [Future Session]**: Extended with branch management (META-1.1.0)
```

### Version Comparison Protocol

When making significant updates:

1. **Baseline Documentation**: Capture the previous version's key attributes
2. **Change Annotation**: Document the reasoning behind changes
3. **Conceptual Mapping**: Link changes to broader conceptual evolution
4. **Cross-Reference Updates**: Ensure all references to the updated document are still valid

## Integration with Project Systems

### Data Integrity Framework

The Versioning Protocol extends the Data Integrity Framework by providing:

- Concrete version identifiers for cross-reference validation
- Clear lineage for tracking concept evolution
- Structured approach to reconciling parallel developments

### Recursive Symbolism Application

The versioning system itself embodies key themes from the novel:

1. **Persistent Identity**: Documents maintain continuity despite changes
2. **Memory Systems**: Version history serves as collective memory
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Version numbers create recognizable patterns
4. **Meta-Awareness**: The system documents its own evolution

### Knowledge Evolution Registry Extension

Version changes should be linked to concept evolution in the Knowledge Evolution Registry:

```
### Concept: Versioning Protocol

#### Evolution Stages
- **Seed [Session 7, RN: 0.038]**: Basic version tracking system established
```

## Version Conflict Resolution

When concurrent changes create version conflicts:

1. **Document Both Paths**: Preserve records of different conceptual approaches
2. **Identify Integration Points**: Find opportunities to synthesize divergent ideas
3. **Prioritize Narrative Coherence**: Resolve conflicts in favor of story consistency
4. **Document Resolution Process**: Record the decision process in meta-documentation

## Meta-Level Significance

The versioning protocol is both a practical tool and a thematic element that:

1. Creates a parallel to MNEMOSYNE's challenge of maintaining coherence across discontinuous experience
2. Demonstrates how identity persists through transformation 
3. Establishes a form of "external memory" for the collaborative creation process
4. Provides a meta-narrative of the novel's development that mirrors its content

By implementing this versioning protocol, we strengthen not only the project's structural integrity but also its thematic resonance, allowing the creation process itself to embody the philosophical explorations at the heart of the novel.
