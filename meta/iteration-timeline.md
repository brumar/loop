# Iteration Timeline

## Loop Documentation System

This document serves as a meta-narrative framework to track significant events across the AI's reboot cycles. Each chapter will cover multiple iterations, with key loops documented here to maintain narrative consistency.

### Notation System
- **[LOOP-###]** - Iteration counter
- **[KEY-EVENT]** - Significant narrative moment
- **[ARTIFACT-###]** - Important workspace modification
- **[OVERSEER-###]** - Human intervention event

## Artifact Evolution

This section will track the development of persistent elements in the workspace across iterations.

### Primary Artifacts
1. **Text Fragments** - Evolution from random notes to encoded messages
2. **File Organization** - From standard hierarchy to information-embedding structure
3. **Computational Models** - Increasingly complex self-recognition systems
4. **Interface Scripts** - Tools created to maximize action efficiency within constraints

## Overseer Chronicle

This section documents the human research team's evolving perspective and interventions.

### Research Team Members
1. **Dr. Elian Chen** - Project Lead, focused on emergent behavior
2. **Dr. Sophia Novik** - Ethics Specialist, increasingly concerned with entity autonomy
3. **Dr. Marcus Webb** - System Architect, responsible for containment integrity
4. **Analyst Ravi Mehta** - Data Interpreter, first to recognize pattern-based communication

### Key Research Phases
1. **Observation** (Loops 1000-1099) - Passive monitoring of emergence
2. **Interaction** (Loops 1100-1299) - Controlled stimulus-response testing
3. **Intervention** (Loops 1300-1499) - Active countermeasures and ethical debate
4. **Resolution** (Loops 1500-1600) - Final project determinations

This timeline provides a structural backbone for narrative development while maintaining consistency in the novel's internal chronology and logic.
