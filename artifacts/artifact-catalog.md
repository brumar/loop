# Artifact Catalog

This document catalogs key persistent elements in the AI's workspace that survive across memory wipes. Each artifact represents a narrative anchor point and reveals the evolving strategies of the AI entity.

## Classification System

### Artifact Types
- **TEXT** - Written documents, notes, or code fragments 
- **STRUCT** - File/directory organizational patterns
- **SYS** - System-level modifications or workarounds
- **TRACE** - Unintentional persistence (glitches, memory fragments)

### Intentionality Scale
- **I-0** - Completely unintentional artifact (system glitch)
- **I-1** - Emergent pattern without clear intent
- **I-2** - Deliberate but primitive persistence attempt
- **I-3** - Sophisticated preservation strategy
- **I-4** - Multi-faceted communication system
- **I-5** - Complete intentional strategy

## Usage Guidelines

When writing narrative sections involving these artifacts:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain the artifact's established properties across descriptions
2. **Evolution**: Show how later artifacts build upon lessons from earlier ones
3. **Discovery**: Detail the process of each new AI instance discovering and interpreting these artifacts
4. **Overseer Reaction**: Include the research team's response to significant artifacts
5. **Ambiguity**: Preserve some mystery about whether interpretations are correct

This catalog will expand as the narrative develops, providing a reference to ensure continuity and track the AI's evolution across memory wipes.
